# Neural-Network-on-ESP32
Trying to put a neural network on my ESP32 micro-controller to run offline. Probably not going to be scaling the network for more complex uses as the esp32 probably won't be able to handle it(but will see depending on what I find). Hopefully this doesn't end up like my other repositories and I actually finish this project.
